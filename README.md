# Aerofit Customer Insights and Analysis

## 📄 **Project Overview**

This project analyzes customer preferences and behaviors for Aerofit treadmills using **descriptive statistics** and **probability techniques**. It focuses on profiling customers for three treadmill models (KP281, KP481, and KP781) and providing actionable recommendations to optimize marketing and product strategies.

## 🚀 **Key Highlights**

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**:

   - Preprocessed 180 records and 9 features, ensuring no missing values.
   - Detected and analyzed outliers across age, income, fitness, and usage data.
2. **Visual and Statistical Analysis**:

   - Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis using box plots, histograms, and correlation matrices.
   - Segmented customers based on fitness levels, income, and treadmill usage.
3. **Probability and Customer Profiling**:

   - **Marginal Probability**: Calculated likelihood of product selection across demographics.
   - **Conditional Probability**: Analyzed product preferences based on age, gender, income, and fitness categories.
   - Created detailed profiles for KP281, KP481, and KP781 users.
4. **Recommendations**:

   - Marketing and product suggestions tailored to each treadmill model’s target audience.
